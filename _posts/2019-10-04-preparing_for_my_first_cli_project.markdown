My progress in my coursework is going by pretty quickly. I want to cement my understanding of OOP before starting my first project. I am currently working on Student Scraper Lab and I have the CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project Lab before I can start my project. I am going to slow down my pace and practice more OOP concepts like Scraping and Modules. I plan on going back and re-reading previous lessons and redoing the labs. 

I am really enjoying learning all of what I am learning so far and I am excited at the outcome of all this. Work has been really rough with a lot of turnover and many of my managment team leaving the company, with my current manager hiring people unfit for their jobs. It just makes me want to work at this much harder so I can start my new career as soon as I can.
