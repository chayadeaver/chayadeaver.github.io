I still have a few more weeks before my Sinatra project so I have been thinking about a few ideas. I want to keep the theme I had with my CLI project that involves around food and restaurants. My CLI Data Gem project was about displaying restaurants and their attributes based on Yelp's API data. For my Sinatra project, I want to create a web application that allows users to make online orders for a local coffee shop make/bakery. 

The idea is that in order to be able to order from this cafe, one would need to sign up for an account. Once an account is created, it should take the user to a menu page that displays different drinks and bakery items. I want to these pages look nice as well so I plan on doing a good deal of CSS. It has to be functional and practical. I might include images as well, but I'm not sure yet. This is why I wanted to go ahead and get a headstart on it so I have time to tweak the CSS after I get the Ruby/html part working. 

The reason why I wanted to do my project on something like online ordering is because I've worked at Starbucks for the last seven years and I'm familar with their mobile ordering system on the employee side and customer side. There are many things that I like about their system but there are also things that could be better. I am also an avid user of mobile ordering systems in general. I am an introvert and I have a toddler so a lot of times I just need to grab stuff really quickly and don't have the time to talk to people when I can just order from an app. I've had experience being on the user end of mobile ordering systems and now that I'm learning how to create web applications like this, it brings it all together so hopefully I can contribute something worthwhile. I am still gathering some more information and will update more when I get a better grasp of exactly how I want my project to look.
